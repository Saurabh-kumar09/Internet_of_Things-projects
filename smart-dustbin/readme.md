# Smart Dustbin
### Problem Statement: - 
The problem of inefficient waste management can be addressed by developing 
a smart dustbin that uses IoT technology and sensors, to address this issue develop an automated waste collection and management system.

### Our solution
A **smart dustbin** is an innovative waste management system that utilizes **IoT technology** and 
**sensors** for automated waste collection and management. It addresses the problem of inefficient waste management 
by optimizing waste collection, reducing environmental pollution, and improving overall sanitation.

Smart dustbins are equipped with sensors that detect when the bin is full and trigger automated waste collection. 
This means that waste is collected promptly and efficiently, reducing the chances of overflowing bins and littering. 
Additionally, the _system uses **data analytics** to provide insights into waste generation patterns_, 
allowing for the identification of opportunities for waste reduction and recycling.

The smart dustbin system also enables better monitoring and tracking of waste collection, allowing for more efficient
management of waste collection and transportation routes. This not only reduces costs but also decreases the environmental impact of waste collection vehicles.

Smart dustbins are a promising solution to the problem of inefficient waste management, 
as they have the potential to revolutionize waste management and improve the quality of life 
for people globally. With their advanced features and capabilities, _smart dustbins can contribute to a more sustainable and cleaner world_.
